# MVVM Examples with Swift
Using [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/examples/) examples as a starting point, I hope to point out how to use MVVM in various views of on iOS application.

## Brief
Most of the view code that I am going to write will be written in code so that the concepts are easily digestable without needing to consult a storyboard (with the exception of the window and root view controller).

## Lessons
1. Hello iPhone, simple text box form that responds to text changes and updates a label

## Dependencies
- [ReactiveCocoa](http://github.com/reactivecocoa/reactivecocoa) This is the key to binding, signal chaining and other awesome stuff.
- [PureLayout](https://github.com/smileyborg/PureLayout) Simple way to do declaritive auto layout without the extra keystrokes.
